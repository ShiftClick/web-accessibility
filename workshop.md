# Accessibility Workshop

The following stats are taken from WHO (World Health Organisation):

> About 90% of people with the disabilities in the list above, live in the developing world.

Even if we hear about the number of people who experience these disabilities, developers often mistakenly believe that these people aren't within their own userbase.

> 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide

That's nearly 4 times the population size of the UK and Israel combined

> 39 million of these are blind

>   + 82% of blind people are over 50 years old

This age group constitutes 20% of the world, and many developing countries have an aging population

Think about your own website. Have you written it under the assumption that your users will be accessing your content with a mouse?

**Pair up with someone new, preferably someone whose website you haven't seen before.**

**Open up your neighbour's website.**

1. Try accessing every piece of content on the site using only your keyboard.

2. Download the [HTML 5 outliner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?hl=en) chrome extension. Then go back to the website and click on the new icon in your toolbar.
  + Is the content semantic?  
  Screen reader users navigate the page based on the order of the elements in the DOM. Does the order look sensible?

3. Put in your earphones. Then download the [ChromeVox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) chrome extension. Don't go back to your neighbour's website yet!
  + Go to www.gov.uk and try navigating around, using only your keyboard, until you feel comfortable with the functionality of ChromeVox
  + Click on the tab/window that contains your neighbour's website
  + Close your eyes!
  + Navigate the site using only ChromeVox to help you

Note: You can disable ChromeVox with Shift+Alt or going to Settings -> Extensions, finding ChromeVox and ticking disable.


But [accessibility isn't only about the blind](http://a11yproject.com/posts/myth-accessibility-is-blind-people/).
